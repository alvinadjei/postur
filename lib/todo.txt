Additional Component & UI Needs:

NEED TO MOVE INVITES BELOW DESCRIPTION IN CREATE EVENTS MODAL AND EVENT 
DETAILS MODAL.

NEED TO ADD UI TO ADD PEOPLE TO AN EVENT.

- Center map, on start up, on users current location.
- Show loading circle whenever interacting with an event in a way that sends stuff to the backend

Graphical Errors:
- Error on iPhone SE (and potentially thinner screens). On messages
    screen, message representation in menu seems to clip off screen,
    creating a render error. On tags screen, requests is forced to
    wrap to multiple lines. I would like to address this by forcing
    an event title to shrink in size so that it fits properly, but
    this will be addressed later.
