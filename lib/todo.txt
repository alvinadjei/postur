Additional Component & UI Needs:
1.) Need to build address search autocomplete list below input address
    field in dialog pop up/modal. [DONE]
2.) Need to add profile picture to center of profile page QR code.
    Perhaps this could be done with a Stack widget, but I am thus far
    unsure...
3.) Need to build function that generates map marker icons (properly)
4.) Need to build functionality to cluster map icons together when you
    zoom out far enough
5.) Need to Have a convenient way to Edit Event Title in Create Event
    modal.
6.) Need to have a convenient way to edit event description.
7.) Center map, on start up, on users currentl location.

Graphical Errors:
1.) Error on iPhone SE (and potentially thinner screens). On messages
    screen, message representation in menu seems to clip off screen,
    creating a render error. On tags screen, requests is forced to
    wrap to multiple lines. I would like to address this by forcing
    an event title to shrink in size so that it fits properly, but
    this will be addressed later.
