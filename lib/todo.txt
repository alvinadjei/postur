Additional Component & UI Needs:
1.) Need to build address search autocomplete list below input address
    field in dialog pop up/modal.
2.) Need to add profile picture to center of profile page QR code.
    Perhaps this could be done with a Stack widget, but I am thus far
    unsure...

Graphical Errors:
1.) Error on iPhone SE (and potentially thinner screens). On messages
    screen, message representation in menu seems to clip off screen,
    creating a render error. On tags screen, requests is forced to
    wrap to multiple lines. I would like to address this by forcing
    an event title to shrink in size so that it fits properly, but
    this will be addressed later.
